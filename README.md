# Stock Market Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This Python project focuses on predicting stock market prices using machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to develop a model that can provide accurate predictions based on historical stock data.

## Project Structure
- *1. Data Collection:* Retrieve historical stock market data. This project assumes the use of financial libraries or APIs for data acquisition.

- *2. Data Preprocessing:* Clean and preprocess the collected data. Handle missing values, remove outliers, and format the data for model training.

- *3. Feature Engineering:* Extract relevant features from the dataset that might influence stock prices. Consider technical indicators, moving averages, and other relevant financial metrics.

- *4. Model Selection:* Choose and implement machine learning models suitable for time-series forecasting. Common choices include linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods.

- *5. Model Training:* Train the selected model using historical data. Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

- *6. Model Evaluation:* Assess the model's accuracy and performance using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

- *7. Hyperparameter Tuning:* Fine-tune model parameters to enhance prediction accuracy.

- *8. Prediction:* Utilize the trained model to make future stock price predictions.

- *9. Visualization:* Visualize the predicted prices alongside actual prices using plots or charts for a comprehensive analysis.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib


## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-prediction-project.git
   cd stock-prediction-project
   

2. Run the project:
   bash
   python stock_prediction.py
   

## Note
- This project is for educational purposes and does not guarantee accurate stock market predictions.
- Adjustments may be needed based on the specific stock market data source and requirements.
